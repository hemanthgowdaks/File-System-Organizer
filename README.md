## File System Organization
- This project aims to enhance file organization on your computer by **grouping similar files together based on their extensions**. 
- Additionally, it provides a tree-view feature, allowing users to easily visualize all files and their nested structures for improved readability.
- It also includes a helpful function, **`helpFn`**, which can be invoked in the terminal. Calling **`helpFn`** will provide you with the commands for utilizing both the organizer and tree features.
